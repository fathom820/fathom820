# About me
Hi! My name is Michael Frank. I'm a student and aspiring developer. Currently, I'm in my third year of studying computer science at Shippensburg University, and I plan on selecting a focus on either software engineering or cyber-security. At the moment I'm actively seeking out internship opportunities in the computer science field.

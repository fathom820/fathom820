# About me
Hi! My name is Michael Frank. I'm a student and aspiring developer. Currently, I'm going into my second year of studying computer science at Shippensburg University. At the moment I'm actively seeking out internship opportunities in the computer science field, though I've begun to hone my interests down to software development and security.

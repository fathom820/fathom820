# About me
My name is Michael Frank. I'm a student and aspiring developer. Currently, I'm going into my second year of studying computer science at Shippensburg University. At the moment I'm actively seeking out internship opportunities in the computer science field, though I've begun to hone my interests down to software development and security.

# Projects
I've developed several "complete" projects over the years, most of which I have ported over to GitHub for easy viewing. They can be viewed in my `Repositories` section.

### Current
- (2021) Arcana, a text-based fighting game with a linear storyline. 

### Past
- (2018) Breakout, an implementation of Atari Breakout in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- (2019) [Physics](https://physics.michaelfrank.repl.co/), a simple physics engine built with JavaScript

# Experience
In the past, I've participated at 3 iD Tech summer camps at West Chester University:
- (2016) Video Game Level Design

As of 2021 I am a member of the Game Development Club at Shippensburg University. So far, we've participated in:
- (2021) Metroidvania Game Jam

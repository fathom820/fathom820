# About me
My name is Michael Frank. I'm a student and aspiring developer. Currently, I'm going into my second year of studying computer science at Shippensburg University.

# Experience
In the past, I've participated at 3 iD Tech summer camps at West Chester University:
- (2016): Video Game Level Design
- (2017): Programming in C++
- (2018): Cyber-security & Encryption

At the moment I'm actively seeking out internship opportunities in the computer science field, though I've begun to hone my interests down to software development and security.
